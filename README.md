# NPS-block_match
*NPS-block_match* provides tools for viewing block hashes:

* `block_match_viewer`, a GUI for viewing the block hashes found using *hashdb* and *bulk_extractor*.
* `be_scan`, a tool that runs a *bulk_extractor* *hashdb* scan of a media image against a *hashdb* database to generate the output that is required as input to the `block_match_viewer` tool.

*NPS-block_match* tools require Python3.
